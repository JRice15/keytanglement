### Project Description
Keytanglement is a web server that allows you to communicate over secure, encrypted messaging with a quantum key generated by a quantum computer. 
The server uses Bell states for Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) which has significant improvement over the simpler BB84 method. In Song and Chen's research paper
cited below, the hardware implementation of this method required only 11 qubits to detect an eavesdropper while BB84 requires 72 qubits for the same security level. 
We modified the implementation of the Bell state algorithm to abide by the modified architecture in the proposed challenge. Further explanation of the challenge,
our implementation, and its success can be found in the accompanying Jupyter notebook.
