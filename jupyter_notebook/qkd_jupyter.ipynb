    " Eve is an eavesdropper and tried to decode the key they are using by snooping on their communications to a quantum computer. Thus, the communications required to get a key must not include enough information for Eve to determine the key. In this scenario, Eve is snooping on the quantum circuit and can insert measurements. A proposed system architecture is included below, we show our system architecture in the Implementation section.\n",

    "### The Research\n",
    " We implemented a Bell state QKD solution which requires only 11 bits to determine if an eavesdropper exists as opposed to the commonly used BB84 algorithm which requires 72 bits. The paper we used by Song and Chen can be found [here](doi: 10.1109/LCOMM.2020.2988380).\n",
    "\n",
    " Their research used a physical quantum system which differs from our software simulation of the QKD problem since Alice and Bob share a physical quantum connection. The original implementation is summarized and the changes are described below.\n",
    "\n",
    " Bell states are a superposition of qubits that causes entaglements. The four two-qubit gates are shown below.\n",
    " ![BellStates](bell_states.png)\n",
    "\n",
    " The original implementation had 4 qubits. \n",
    " 1. Alice chooses to randomly entangle two pairs of qubits according to the table below, where G is a group code associated with the superposition. \n",
    " 2. Then, she sends the qubits to Bob in a random order.\n",
    " 3. Bob randomly pairs the qubits and performs a measurement in the Bell basis.\n",
    " 4. Like BB84, he sends Alice information on his measurements, and she checks for correctness.\n",
    " 5. They share some pairing information to ensure no eavesdropper performed a measurement between Alice and Bob.\n",
    " 6. They extract the key from their pairing information and communicate!\n",
    "\n",
    " ![Gtable](group_codes.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " ### Our implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The main issue of implementing the QKD above is that we do not understand how to perform steps 2 and 3 using Qiskit. Instead we derived a different but similar method to extract information from the Bell states.\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Alice chooses to randomly entangle two pairs of qubits according to the table below, where G is a group code associated with the superposition according to the table below.\n",
    " 2. **Bob randomly pairs the qubits, and performs a reverse operation of a group code.**\n",
    " 3. **Due to quantum circuit symmetry properties, if Bob performs the exact reverse of Alice's circuit, \n",
    "    the computational basis measurement will be the initial state or |0000>.**\n",
    " 4. Like BB84, he sends Alice information on his measurements that are correct (have a state vector of |0000>).\n",
    " 5. They share some pairing information to ensure no eavesdropper performed a measurement between Alice and Bob.\n",
    " 6. They extract the key from the **group codes of the correct guesses** and communicate!"
